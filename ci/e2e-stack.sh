#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Throwaway E2E compose stack lifecycle (P17). Brings the docker-compose.yaml stack up
# on an EMPTY volume (Postgres → one-off migrate+seed → backend → frontend IMAGE), waits
# for the backend to be healthy, then — on `down` — tears it ALL down WITH its volume
# (`down -v`) so every run starts from a clean database. Never points at the cluster/dev
# DB: the compose Postgres is self-contained and disposable.
#
# Usage:
#   ci/e2e-stack.sh up     # build/pull-free: images must already exist; up + wait
#   ci/e2e-stack.sh down   # docker compose down -v (volume gone)
#
# Caller provides via env (the pipeline sets these; local defaults are fine):
#   COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME   isolates networks/volumes for concurrent builds (default mm-e2e)
#   BACKEND_IMAGE          backend image ref   (default modelmatch-backend:latest)
#   FRONTEND_IMAGE         frontend image ref under test (default modelmatch-frontend:latest)
#   JWT_SECRET             REQUIRED for `up` (compose rejects the placeholder)
#   BACKEND_PORT           host port to poll for /healthz (default 8000)
#   FRONTEND_PORT          host port the FE image binds (default 8080)
